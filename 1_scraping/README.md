# Scraping

The first step for developing a domain-specific LLM is go gather a large collection of text relevant to the domain of interest. In this case, ConfliBERT focuses on politics and violent conflict. For that reason, the documents used to pre-train this LLM focus primarily on international and domestic political dynamics, conflict processes and cooperation, as well as violent incidents at large or small scale.
